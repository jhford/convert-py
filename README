This is a simple project to support batch conversion of audio file formats.  Ideally, it'll drive through errors and tell you at the end which things failed instead of dieing half way through.

Right now, it's messy and only supports flac.

The input system is also horrible.  generate files that have lists of flac files and pass them as args to convert.py. Example

find music -name *.flac > files-to-convert
